                    	<img src="photos/GEDC1480.JPG">

        <p>To make this colourful and abstract painting, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Canvas (or a peice of wood)</li>
          <li>White acrylic paint</li>
          <li>White glue</li>
          <li>White napkins or tissue paper</li>
          <li>Food colouring (assorted colours)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paint the wood white (or if it's a canvas just leave it white) and glue the napkins or tissue paper down onto the wood. Make sure it isn't flat. You're going to want it to be bumpy and have different shapes in the paper you glued down. Slowly drip the food colouring all over the napkins. The food colouring shouls spread out a bit if it was dropped onto the napkins (not the wood). </p>
