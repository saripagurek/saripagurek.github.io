            Designing in High School
          </h5>
          <h6> I love design- in fact, it’s something I might pursue further education in after my undergrad. There are  many aspects of high school that require design - and lucky for me, I was able to find opportunities and be heavily involved in my high school’s community.
          </h6>
          <h6>I started by joining my school’s yearbook team, a club that was recruiting new members when I was in grade ten. I applied to be an executive, unsure of the commitment I had just made. It turns out, designing a yearbook is actually pretty fun. I was the Executive Student Life & Photography Editor for my final two years of high school. My fellow team members and I were always running around the school, snapping shots of school life, events, teachers, and anything particularly interesting going on. After weeding through hundreds of photos, we were all responsible for designing our own sections of the book (mine being Student Life). We used Friesens printing software to create our layouts, share project colours, organize photos, group edit, etc. Yearbook got much more difficult and time consuming in 2020 with school closures due to the pandemic, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. Group-calling my friends to edit page designs was definitely my favourite way to procrastinate other things.
          </h6>
          <h6>At the end of grade eleven, especially with the new found time on my hands resulting from online school, I had quite liked actually putting effort into school extracurriculars and decided to apply for Student Council. I had originally applied for the Spirit Committee: a group of students responsible for school spirit, because let’s face it that just sounds the most fun, but my friend who had just been elected Co-President asked if I’d consider the Fundraising Committee as she thought it would suit me. I’m glad she did, as this gave me the opportunity to be responsible for the school’s clothing and merchandise. A concept which, to my surprise, did not have to have the same font and design as every other high school in the city. I don’t think I ever realized that there was actually a person in charge of designing school clothes- I had never thought twice about it. I made it my mission with our first round of sales to not follow the standard text and font of generic high school sweaters, and we ended up going with a design I made with the silhouette of the school’s building. Throughout the year we had more rounds of sales, and it didn’t take very long for me to realize we didn’t actually have a vector file of the school’s crest. How?? I’m still not sure. Lost to time I guess. I decided to vectorize a version of the crest, which ultimately was used on multiple rounds of merchandise. Word got around quickly, and soon I had teachers with different jpegs of school logos to vectorize. This was one of the more humorous parts of the last two years: just how many designs and vectors I made for staff. My Communications Technology teacher did a pretty good job of getting me design gigs around the school.
