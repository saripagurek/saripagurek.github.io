        <p>You can make 3D bubbles with any word in them by simply making a ball of hot glue over any word ina newspaper. When it's dry, you just cut it out and you have a clear bubble with a word at the bottom. You can also make the bubble over a picture or a character from a comic strip from the newspaper.</p>

        <p>To make this colourful and abstract painting, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Canvas (or a peice of wood)</li>
          <li>White acrylic paint</li>
          <li>White glue</li>
          <li>White napkins or tissue paper</li>
          <li>Food colouring (assorted colours)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paint the wood white (or if it's a canvas just leave it white) and glue the napkins or tissue paper down onto the wood. Make sure it isn't flat. You're going to want it to be bumpy and have different shapes in the paper you glued down. Slowly drip the food colouring all over the napkins. The food colouring shouls spread out a bit if it was dropped onto the napkins (not the wood). </p>
