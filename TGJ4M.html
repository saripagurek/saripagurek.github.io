      <h5> Independent Project: Unreal Engine
      </h5>
      <h6> Creating the game:
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal1.png">
      <h6> My first attempt at setting up a level: Creating a platform out of a box and forming walls to avoid falling off. Ultimately I learned this method would not work to create natural looking landscapes as the box cannot be sculpted in the way an actual landscape within Unreal Engine can.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal4.png">
      <h6>Creating an enemy character: As this project had a timeline of a week, this character is a royalty free asset from Mixamo.
        Creating the character involved importing the skeleton, material texture, and glossiness; linking it to a running animation; linking it's skeletal mesh to an AI controller; and giving the AI the objective of seeking out the player.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal2.png">
      <h6>Character movement: Linking the 3D character to it's running animation, and adjusting controls like speed and transitions.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal3.png">
      <h6>Programming Character: So far, this character has minimal programming other than the objectives of it's AI controller.
        At this point I realized the character would chase down the player within the environment, but would only face left.
        This is the event graph behind the character pawn to make it face the player.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal5.png">
      <h6>First Level: This is what my first level attempt looked like after trying to add landscape sculpting abilities on top of the prexisting box platform I had made.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal6.png">
      <h6>Second Level Attempt: After learning more about how to use the landscaping mode, I decided to ditch my first attempt at an environment and start over.
        This allowed the creation of much more realistic looking hills using the blueprint brush tool. The lime green surface is the rendering of the enemy character's navigation box.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal7.jpg">
      <h6>Adding details to the landscape, and updating the character.
      </h6>
      <img src="photos/unreal8.jpg">
      <img src="photos/unreal9.jpg">
      <img src="photos/unreal10.jpg">
      <h6> In the finished game (a standard first-person shooter style video game), you are spawned in a
        rolling forest landscape with a mythical dog-looking creature. The creature will seek your character down unless you find it and shoot it first.
        WASD keys are used to move, plus space to jump, and click to shoot.

      <h5>Coded Bias Documentary Reflection
      </h5>
      <h6>“Coded Bias”  Documentary Reflection
	Coded Bias illustrates the issues of personal information and privacy as well as the racism and sexism that is integrated within the evolving industry of artificial intelligence and facial recognition software. MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini starts by demonstrating how a sample facial recognition software quite literally requires her to wear a white mask to be fully detected. Hearing this, I was quite surprised by how blatantly racist the system was, but upon her explanation it makes full sense. Artificial intelligence learns from the data it is given, and since the technological industry is dominated by white men; women, people of colour, and minority groups are recognized with the lowest accuracy.
      </h6>
      <h6>In another real-life example given, a high-tech company using AI as a first scan through resume applications was shown to actively reject female applications from continuing on in the hiring process. This just goes to show how a system learning from societies flawed ways skews itself and continues on the cycle. I don’t believe that these softwares are inherently bad, but without societal change in the way we view roles within the industry, the “coded bias” will continue to discriminate.
      </h6>
      <h6>Coded Bias also addresses the personal profile of information gathered from all people on the web. Before watching the documentary I was aware of how many large companies collect personal information, like social media and google, but I think it’s important to recognize how these companies share your information for things like targeted advertising. The film definitely highlighted how little I know about company’s data policies and their terms and conditions.
